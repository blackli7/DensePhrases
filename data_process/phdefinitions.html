<p><a name="RotationalMotion"></a></p>

<h2>Rotational Motion</h2>

<p><b>Rotational Inertia:</b> That property of an object to
resist any change in its state of rotation. If at rest the body
tends to remain at rest; if rotating, it tends to remain rotating
and will continue to do so unless acted upon by a net external
torque.</p>

<p><b>Torque:</b> The product of force and lever-arm distance,
which tends to produce rotation.</p>

<p><b>Center of Mass:</b> The average position of mass or the
single point associated with an object where all its mass can be
considered to be concentrated.</p>

<p><b>Center of Gravity:</b> The average position of weight or
the single point associated with an object where the force of
gravity can be considered to ace. Usually the same place as the
center of mass.</p>

<p><b>Equilibrium:</b> The state of an object when not acted upon
by a net force or net torque. An object in equilibrium may be at
rest or moving at uniform velocity; that is, not accelerating<b>.</b></p>

<p><b>Centripetal Force:</b> A center-seeking force that causes
an object to follow a circular path<br>
F = (mv`2)/r</p>

<p><b>Centrifugal Force:</b> An outward force that is due to
rotation. In an inertial frame of reference, it is fictitious in
the sense that it doesn't act on the rotating object but on
whatever supplied the centripetal force; it is the reaction to
the centripetal force. In a rotating frame of reference, it does
act on the rotating body and is fictitious in the sense that it
is not an interaction with an agent or entity such as mass or
charge but is a force in itself that is solely a product of
rotation; it has no reaction-force counterpart.</p>

<p><b>Angular Momentum:</b> A measure of an object's rotation
about a particular axis; more specifically, the product of its
rotational inertia and rotational velocity. For an object that is
small compared to the radial distance, it is the product of mass
speed, and radial distance of rotation.<br>
Angular Momentum = rotational inertia x rotational velocity (mvr)</p>

<p><b>Conservation of Angular Momentum:</b> When no external
torque acts on an object or a system of objects, no changes of
angular momentum takes place. Hence, the angular momentum before
an event involving only internal torques is equal to the angular
momentum after the event<br>
</p>

<p><a name="Gravity"></a></p>

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p><b>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion:</b><br>
1] Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one
focus<br>
2] The line form the sun to any planet sweeps out equal areas of
space in equal time intervals<br>
3] The squares of the times of revolution (days, months or years)
of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their average
distances from the sun<b>.</b></p>

<p><b>Law of Universal Gravitation:</b> Every mass in the
universe attracts every other mass with a force that for two
masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
separating them<br>
F = (G(m1*m2))/d^2</p>

<p><b>Inverse-Square Law:</b> A law relating the intensity of an
effect to the inverse square of the distance from the cause.
Intensity ~ 1/distance`2<br>
Gravity follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of
electric, magnetic, light, sound, and radiation phenomena</p>

<p><b>Weightlessness:</b>condition wherein gravitational pull
appears to be A lacking.</p>

<p><b>Spring Tide:</b> A high or low tide that occurs when the
sun, earth, and moon are all lined up so that the tides due to
the sun and moon coincide, making the high tides higher than
average and the low tides lower than average</p>

<p><b>Neap Tide:</b> A tide that occurs when the moon is midway
between new and full, in either direction. Tides due to the sun
and moon partly cancel, making the high tides lower and the low
tides higher than average.</p>

<p><b>Gravitational Field:</b> The space surrounding a massive
body in which another mass experiences a force of attraction</p>

<p><b>Black Hole:</b> The configuration of a massive star that
has undergone gravitational collapse, in which gravitation at the
surface is so intense that even the star's own light cannot
escape.</p>

<p><b>Big Bang:</b> The primordial explosion that is thought to
have resulted in the expanding universe</p>

<p><b>Stability:</b> In order for an object to be stable, its
center of gravity must lie directly above a point of support</p>

<p>The state of motion of the center of mass in a system can only
be changed by forces outside the system</p>

<p><b>Escape Speed: </b>That speed which is sufficient to propel
an object away from a planet, or any object</p>

<p><b>Tides:</b> Tides are caused by the variation of force on
the earth exerted by the moon (and the sun)<br>
The effect of the moon is about 4 times greater than that of the
sun.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="SatelliteMotion"></a></p>

<h2>Satellite Motion</h2>

<p><i>Summary of Terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Satellite:</b> A projectile or small celestial body that
orbits a larger celestial body.</p>

<p><b>Ellipse:</b> The closed oval-like curve wherein the sum of
the distances from any point on the curve to both foci is a
constant. When the foci are together at one point, the ellipse is
a circle. The farther apart the foci, the more eccentric the
ellipse.</p>

<p><b>Escape Speed:</b> The speed that a projectile, space probe,
or similar object must reach to escape the gravitational
influence of the earth or celestial body to which it is
attracted.</p>

<p><i>Equations, Equivalences, and Concepts:</i></p>

<p>The sum or KE and PE for a satellite is a constant at all
points along its orbit.</p>

<p>For a satellite in circular orbit, it is always moving
perpendicularly to the earth’s gravitational field.</p>

<p>Because a satellite moves at right angles to the earth’s
gravitational field, no change in speed occurs - only a change in
direction.</p>

<p>The higher the orbit of a satellite, the less it’s speed
and the longer it’s period.</p>

<p><a name="Electricity"></a></p>

<h2>Electricity</h2>

<p>The force between two electrically charged objects is </p>

<p>F=(Kq1q2)/r^2 (r=distance, q=charges, k=proportionality
constant)</p>

<p>E = Elemental electric charge (-1.6 x 10-19 Coulombs)</p>

<p><b>Conductor</b> - allows electric charge to move thru it</p>

<p><b>Insulator</b> - materials in which the electrons are tightly
bound</p>

<pre>E=F/q	F=Eq	A=F/M=Eq/M	W=FD=EqD</pre>

<p>1 Volt=1 Joule/1 Coulomb</p>

<p>Ampere=Coulombs/Second (A=q/s)</p>

<p>1 Amp=6.25 x 1018 electrons/second</p>

<p>1 Amp(120V)=120W</p>

<p><b>A=V/R</b> V=voltage</p>

<p><b>What determines resistance?</b></p>

less R, longer means more R</p>

<p><i>Electric current flows from high potential to low potential
(volts)</i></p>

<p>Thus in a -12v DC battery the current travels from - to +</p>

<p><b>How are electricity and gravity the same?</b></p>

<p>They both a forces, and follow the inverse-square law</p>

<p><b>How are they different?</b></p>

<p>Electricity is a much stronger force</p>

<p>Gravity is exclusively attractive, while electricity is both
repellant and attractive</p>

<p><a name="Color"></a></p>

<h2>Color</h2>

<p>At the resonant frequencies where the amplitudes of
oscillation are large, light is absorbed. But at frequencies
below and above the resonant frequencies, light is re- emitted
(reflected)</p>

<p>An object can only reflect frequencies that are present in the
illuminating light.</p>

<p>A red piece of glass appears red because it absorbs all the
colors that compose white light, except red, which it transmits.</p>

<p>The energy of the absorbed frequencies increase the kinetic
energy of the molecules and the glass is warmed.</p>

<p>Any of the three additive primaries can be produced by a
combination of any two of cyan, magenta, or yellow pigments. The
latter three are called <b>subtractive primary colors.</b></p>

<p>A color plus its opposite (<b>complementary) </b>produce
white.</p>

<p>The tinier the particle, the higher the frequency of light it
will scatter.</p>

<p>Of the visible frequencies violet light is scattered the most,
followed by blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.</p>

<p>When white light passes through a thick atmosphere, the higher
frequencies are scattered the most while the lower frequencies
are transmitted with minimal scattering.</p>

<p>As the day progresses and the sun is lower in the sky, the
path through the atmosphere is longer, and more blue is scattered
from the sunlight. The removal of blue (through scattering)
leaves the transmitted light more reddish in appearance.</p>

<p>Water is transparent to nearly all the visible frequencies of
light, but strongly absorbs infrared waves.</p>

<p>Water molecules very weakly resonate in the visible red, which
causes a slight absorption of red light in water. Red light is
reduced to a quarter of its initial brightness by 15 meters of
water.</p>

<p><i>Terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Additive primary colors:</b> The three colors, red, blue,
and green, that when added in certain proportions will produce
any color in the spectrum.</p>

<p><b>Subtractive primary colors:</b> The three colors of
absorbing pigments-magenta, yellow, and cyan- that when mixed in
certain proportions will reflect any color in the spectrum.</p>

<p><b>Complementary colors:</b> Any two colors that when added
produce white light.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="ReflectionandRefraction"></a></p>

<h2>Reflection and Refraction</h2>

<p><b>Fermat’s Principle:</b> Out of all possible paths that
light might take, to get from one point to another, it takes the
path that requires the shortest time.</p>

<p><b>Law of Reflection: </b>The angle of incidence equals the
angle of reflection.</p>

<p><b>Plane mirrors:</b> The observer sees the image of a candle
at a point <i>behind</i> the mirror. The light rays do not
actually come from this point, so the image is called a <i>virtual
image.</i></p>

<p><b>Causes of refraction:</b> the bending is caused by a change
in speed.</p>

<p><b>Dispersion:</b> Violet light travels about one percent
slower in ordinary glass than does red light.</p>

<p><i>Terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Reflection: </b>the return of light rays from a surface in
such a way that the angle at which a given ray is returned is
equal to the angle at which it strikes the surface. When the
reflecting surface is irregular, light is returned in irregular
directions; this is <i>diffuse reflection.</i></p>

<p><b>Refraction: </b>the bending of an oblique ray of light when
it passes from one transparent medium to another.</p>

<p><b>Critical angle: </b>the minimum angle of incidence at which
a light ray is totally reflected within a medium.</p>

<p><b>Total internal reflection: </b>the total reflection of
light traveling in a medium when it strides on the surface of a
less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle.</p>

<p><b>Converging lens: </b>A lens that is thicker in the middle
than at the edges and refracts parallel rays passing through it
to a focus.</p>

<p><b>Diverging lens: </b>A lens that is thinner in the middle
than at the edges, causing parallel ray passing through it to
diverge.</p>

<p><b>Virtual image: </b>an image formed by light rays that do
not converge at the location of the image. A virtual image is
that reflected by a mirror; it cannot be displayed on a screen.</p>

<p><b>Real image: </b>An image formed by light rays that converge
at the location of the image. A real image can be displayed on a
screen.</p>

<p><b>Aberration: </b>a limitation on perfect image formation
inherent, to some degree, in all particle systems.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="LightWaves"></a></p>

<h2>Light Waves</h2>

<p>A soap bubble appears iridescent in white light when the
thickness of the soap film is about the same as a wavelength of
light.</p>

<p>Bright fringes occur when waves (from both slits) arrive in
phase; dark areas result from the overlapping of waves that are
out of phase.</p>

<p>Diffraction grating disperses white light into colors, and are
used in spectrometers.</p>

<p>The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the
wave compared to the size of the obstruction that casts the
shadow. The longer the wave compared to the obstruction, the more
the diffraction occurs.</p>

<p><i>Terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Huygens’ principle: </b>the theory by which light waves
spreading out from a point source can be regarded as the
superposition of tiny secondary wavelets.</p>

<p><b>Diffraction: </b>the bending of light around an obstacle or
through a narrow slit in such a way that fringes of light and
dark or colored bands are produced.</p>

<p><b>Interference: </b>the superposition of waves producing
regions of reinforcement and regions of cancellation. <i>Constructive
interference</i> refers to regions of reinforcement; <i>destructive
interference</i> refers to regions of cancellation. The
interference of selected wavelengths of light produces colors
known as <i>interference colors.</i></p>

<p><b>Polarization: </b>the alignment of the electric vectors
that make up electromagnetic radiation. Such waves of aligned
vibrations are said to be <i>polarized.</i></p>

<p><b>Hologram: </b>a two dimensional microscopic diffraction
pattern that shows three dimensional optical images.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="LightEmission"></a></p>

<h2>Light Emission</h2>

<p><i>Summary of terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Excitation:</b> the process of boosting electrons in an
atom or molecule from a lower to a higher energy level.</p>

<p><b>Emission Spectrum:</b> the distribution of wavelengths in
the light from a luminous source.</p>

<p><b>Spectroscope:</b> an optical instrument, separates light
into its constituent frequencies in the form of spectral lines</p>

<p><b>Incandescence:</b> the state of glowing while at a high
temperature, caused by electrons in vibration atoms and molecules
that are shaken in and out of their stable energy levels,
emitting radiant energy in the process. The peak frequency of
radiant energy is proportional to the absolute temperature of a
heated substance; f ~ t</p>

<p><b>Absorption Spectrum:</b> a continuous spectrum, like that
of white light, interrupted by dark lines or bands that result
from the absorption of certain frequencies of light by a
substance through which the radiant energy passes.</p>

<p><b>Fluorescence:</b> the property of absorbing radiant energy
of one frequency and re-emitting radiant energy of lower
frequency. Part of the absorbed radiant energy goes into heat and
the other part into excitation; hence the emitted radiant energy
has a lower energy and therefore a lower frequency than the
absorbed radiant energy.</p>

<p><b>Phosphorescence:</b> a type of light emission that is the
same as fluorescence except for a delay between excitation and
de-excitation, which provides an afterglow. The delay is caused
by atoms being excited to energy levels that do not decay
rapidly. The afterglow may last from fractions of a second to
hours, or even days, depending on the type of material,
temperature, and other factors.</p>

<p><b>Laser</b> (light amp. by stimulated emission of radiation):
an optical instrument that produces a beam of coherent
monochromatic light.</p>

<p><i>Notes:</i><b>l=c/f</b></p>

<p>The temperature of incandescent bodies, whether they be stars
or blast-furnace interiors, can be determined by measuring the
peak frequency of radiant energy they emit.</p>

<p>Incoherent white light contains waves of many frequency (and
wavelengths) that are out of phase with one another</p>

<p>Light of a single frequency and wavelength is still out of
phase</p>

<p>Coherent light: all the waves are identical and in phase.</p>

<p><a name="LightQuanta"></a></p>

<h2>Light Quanta</h2>

<p>When the energy of a photon is divided by its frequency, the
single number that results is the proportionality constant,
called <b>Planck’s constant, h </b>(6.6 x 10-34 joule- sec)</p>

<p><b>Observations contrary to the wave picture for the analysis
of photoelectricity:</b></p>

<p>1] the time lag between turning on the light and the ejection
of the first electrons was not affected by the brightness or
frequency of the light. 2] the effect was easy to observe with
violet or ultraviolet light, but not with red light. 3] the rate
at which electrons were ejected was proportional to the
brightness of the light. 4] the maximum energy of the ejected
electrons was not affected by the brightness of the light, but
there were indications that the energy did depend on the
frequency of the light.</p>

<p>-one photon is completely absorbed by each electron ejected
from the metal.(all or nothing)</p>

<p>-the energy of each photon is proportional to the frequency of
light, while the number of photons has to do with its brightness.</p>

<p>-light travels as a wave and hits as a stream of photons</p>

<p>The act of <b>observing</b> something as tiny as an electron
produces a considerable uncertainty in either its position or its
motion.</p>

<p><i>Summary of terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Complementarity:</b> (Bohr) the principle that wave and
particle models of either matter or radiation complement each
other and when combined provide a fuller description of either
one.</p>

<h2>The Atom and the Quantum</h2>

<p><i>Notes:</i></p>

<p>The electron doesn’t radiate light while it accelerates
around the nucleus in a single orbit, but that radiation of light
takes place only when the electron jumps orbit from a higher
energy level to a lower energy level.</p>

<p>Color depends on the (distance of) jump. Bohr’s views
explained the regularities being found in atomic spectra.</p>

<p><i>Summary of terms:</i></p>

<p><b>Ritz combination principle:</b> the theory that the
spectral lines of the elements have frequencies that are either
the sums or the differences of the frequencies of two other
lines.</p>

<p><b>de Broglie matter waves:</b> the associated wave properties
of all particles of matter. The wavelength of a particle wave is
related to its momentum and Planck’s constant, <b>l=h/momentum</b></p>

<p><b>Shrodinger’s wave equation:</b> the fundamental
equation of quantum mechanics, which interprets the wave nature
of material particles in terms of probability wave amplitudes.</p>

<p><b>Correspondence principle</b>: the rule that a new theory is
valid provided that, when it overlaps with the old, it agrees
with the verified results of the old theory.</p>
