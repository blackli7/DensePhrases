Percy Fawcett was born on 18 August 1867 in Torquay, Devon, England, to Edward Boyd Fawcett and Myra Elizabeth (n\u00e9e MacDougall). Fawcett received his early education at Newton Abbot Proprietary College along with Bertram Fletcher Robinson. Fawcett's India-born father was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS); his elder brother Edward Douglas Fawcett (1866\u20131960) was a mountain climber, an Eastern occultist, and the author of philosophical books and popular adventure novels."

Rider Haggard and Arthur Conan Doyle; the latter used Fawcett's Amazonian field reports as an inspiration for his novel \"The Lost World\". Fawcett's first expedition to South America was in 1906 (he was seconded for service there on 2 May) when at the age of 39 he travelled to Brazil to map a jungle area at the border of Brazil and Bolivia at the behest of the Royal Geographical Society. The Society had been commissioned to map the area as a third party unbiased by local national interests. He arrived in La Paz, Bolivia in June. While on the expedition in 1907, Fawcett claimed to have seen and shot a 62 foot long giant anaconda, a claim for which he was ridiculed by scientists. He reported other mysterious animals unknown to zoology, such as a small cat-like dog about the size of a foxhound, which he claimed to have seen twice, and the giant Apazauca spider which was said to have poisoned a number of locals."

After a 1913 expedition, he supposedly claimed to have seen dogs with double noses. These may have been Double-nosed Andean tiger hounds. Based on documentary research, Fawcett had by 1914 formulated ideas about a \"lost city\" he named \"Z\" (\"Zed\") somewhere in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil. He theorized that a complex civilization once existed in the Amazon region and that isolated ruins may have survived. Fawcett also found a document known as , written after explorations made in the sert\u00e3o of the state of Bahia, and housed at the National Library of Rio de Janeiro. It is believed to be by Portuguese bandeirante , who wrote that in 1753 he'd discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with hieroglyphics; the city is described in great detail without providing a specific location.

Williams explained his research in some detail in the preface to his play \"AmaZonia\", first performed in April 2004. In 2005, \"The New Yorker\" staff writer David Grann visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported that it had apparently preserved an oral history about Fawcett, among the first Europeans the tribe had ever seen. The oral account said that Fawcett and his party had stayed at their village and then left, heading eastward. The Kalapalos warned Fawcett and his companions that if they went that way they would be killed by the \"fierce Indians\" who occupied that territory, but Fawcett insisted on going. The Kalapalos observed smoke from the expedition's campfire each evening for five days before it disappeared. The Kalapalos said they were sure the fierce Indians had killed them. The article also reports that a monumental civilisation known as Kuhikugu may have actually existed near where Fawcett was searching, as discovered recently by archaeologist Michael Heckenberger and others. Grann's findings are further detailed in his book \"The Lost City of Z\" (2009)."

The team chose one member to be taken to a campsite; the other began approximately away and was required to hike to the site, using only a compass and bearing to find the way. Either member may tap out at any time, but doing so removed both of them from the competition; in addition, if either member of a team was medically evacuated, both were disqualified. The last remaining team won the $500,000 prize."

He set a goal for himself to last 50 days. After he reached his goal, a large storm hit the island, which Larson described as being larger than any he had seen and prompting his decision to leave the island.

It also has ultimate (and largely discretionary) appellate jurisdiction over all federal court and state court cases that involve a point of federal constitutional or statutory law. The Court has the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution or an executive act for being unlawful. However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones, but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions. Each year it agrees to hear about 100\u2013150 of the more than 7,000 cases that it is asked to review."

However, the Chief Justice\u2014when in the majority\u2014decides who writes the court's opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. While a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories.

Early on, some delegates argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of various tribunals chosen by the national legislature. It was also proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive power to exercise a veto or to revise laws. In the end the Framers of the Constitution compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary, vesting of federal judicial power in \"one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" They delineated neither the exact powers and prerogatives of the Supreme Court nor the organization of the Judicial Branch as a whole."

The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955.

In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states. The Court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through certiorari, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions), the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through certiorari), the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through certiorari), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through certiorari), and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through certiorari).

When the Court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the Court, \"amici curiae\", or \"friends of the court,\" may also file briefs. The Court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the Court may choose to give more time, though this is rare), and during that time, the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. \"Amici curiae\" may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case."

Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.

Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in \"Lochner v. New York\", which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973), which legalized abortion on the basis of the \"right to privacy\" inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in \"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti\" (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. President Abraham Lincoln warned, referring to the \"Dred Scott\" decision, that if government policy became \"irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\" Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: \"You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.\" During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: \"What judges have wrought is a coup d'\u00e9tat,\u00a0\u2013 slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'\u00e9tat nonetheless.\" Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, \"their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like.\" Brian Leiter wrote that \"Given the complexity of the law and the complexity involved in saying what really happened in a given dispute, all judges, and especially those on the Supreme Court, often have to exercise a quasi-legislative power,\" and \"Supreme Court nominations are controversial because the court is a super-legislature, and because its moral and political judgments are controversial.\""

In contrast, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany for example, can directly declare a law unconstitutional upon request. There has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power. While Framers such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton argued in \"The Federalist Papers\" that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments, others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The Supreme Court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005. Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress's power over interstate commerce was \"complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\" Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is \"quite broad.\" Modern day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today. Advocates of states' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the Court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority. Justice Brandeis, in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference, suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy. One critic wrote \"the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law.\" However, others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends \"protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level.\" More recently, the issue of federal power is central in the prosecution of \"Gamble v. United States\", which is examining the doctrine of \"separate sovereigns,\" whereby a criminal defendant can be prosecuted by a state court and then by a federal court."

This season, the callbacks were renamed \"The Vegas Verdicts\". Unlike previous seasons, the acts were not given a chance to perform a second time, unless prompted by the judges to as a challenge. The judges re-watched audition tapes and created a Top 40 based on the acts' preliminary performances, similar to the format used on sister show \"Britain's Got Talent\". However, it was revealed during the first performance show that the judges, when prompted by executive producer Simon Cowell, called back eight acts that they previously had cut. This brought the total number of acts up to 48. Last season, the acts who passed through were divided into four groups, who performed over the course of two weeks with the acts who passed through from the previous night being announced before the next group of acts' performances. This year, each group in the Top 48 was divided into four groups of 12, but only one group performed per week, as a separate results show for the group aired the next day. This season was the first to feature results episodes lasting one hour on a weekly basis since season one."

Leithart provides a number of parallels between the Philistine captivity of the Ark and the Plagues of Egypt in the Book of Exodus. The ark brings about plagues, humbles the gods of the Philistines and returns full of treasure. In fact, the Philistine diviners refer to the events of the Exodus in 1 Samuel 6:6. On the advice of these diviners about how to end the plagues, the Philistines made a guilt offering of five golden tumors and five gold mice (representing the five Philistine rulers). They then placed the gold along with the ark on a cart drawn by two milch cows, who head straight for Israel and do not waver.

In the promo shots of the bakers, the male bakers were given blue icing while the female bakers were given pink icing, whereas the previous year, every baker was given the same colour regardless. As a result, the BBC altered the colouring of the icing. The opening episode had an average viewing figure of 10.4 million according to overnight ratings, an improvement over the figure of 9.3 million for the corresponding episode in 2015. This made it the most watched TV show of 2016 so far, with the official figure also making it the most watched TV show since the 2015 Bake Off Final. Its run on the BBC ended with an average overnight viewing figure of 14 million for the final, peaking at 14.8 million, which is a record for the show. The series dominated the list of most-watched programmes in 2016, with nine of the top ten being episodes of the show. Its finale was watched by 15.9 million viewers (7 days cumulative figure), the most popular of the year.  Official episode viewing figures are from BARB."
